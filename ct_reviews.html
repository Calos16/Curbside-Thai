     <h1>Reviews</h1>
    <p> The culinary art of the food truck vendor has been steadily
     improving over the last 10 years with fine offerings from
     Antonio's Italian, Organic on the Road, and now Curbside Thai.
     Sajja Adulet is to be congratulated for offering delicious
     and authentic Thai food at a reasonable price. We think
     Curbside Thai provides the finest Asian food on or off
     the streets of Charlotte.<p>

    <p> Steaming rice with a spicy Asian sauce is common street fare
     and we all accept its limitations in exchange for the
     convenience of a quick bite on the run. With Curbside Thai you
     don't have to compromise. Building on his experience as a
     master chef at several fine establishments on the East Coast,
     Sajja Adulet has brought the taste of fine dining to the
     Food Cart Wars and we couldn't be happier.</p>
